# Breathe üå¨Ô∏è

Exercise isn't just about running and lifting weights. In these troubling times it is essential to be as prepared as possible and that goes for your lung capacity as well!

COVID-19 is a bastard of a virus that attacks the lungs, which can cause other problems in the body. Having a healthy set of lungs can really help in fighting off the virus and living with harsh effects of it in recovery.

This app is simple: add a time limit and how many intervals you'd like to do in that time. Then just follow the instructions; Inhale, hold, exhale and repeat until completion.

---

TODOS:

- Input time limit

  - Limit the amount of intervals a user can input based off that figure.
  - i.e. 1 minute is 60 seconds, so the possible interval numbers would be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30.
  - Possibly should give all options, but say 1 second is too small so omit that.

- Create function to work out x's divisors

- A component (a modal) that takes time, then based off that, a input range that is limited to the divisors of x.
